        <h3>Fact: The bumblebee bat is the world’s smallest mammal</h3>
        <p>
          Weighing in at 0.05 to 0.07 ounces, with a head-to-body length of 1.14
          to 1.29 inches and a wingspan of 5.1 to 5.7 inches, the bumblebee
          bat—also known as Kitti’s hog-nosed bat—is the smallest mammal in the
          world, according to the Guinness Book of World Records. To see this
          tiny bat for yourself, you’d have to visit one of a select few
          limestone caves on the Khwae Noi River in Kanchanaburi Province of
          southwest Thailand. Here are more of

          Fact: There were active volcanoes on the moon when dinosaurs were
          alive
        </h3>
        <p>
          Most of the volcanoes probably stopped erupting about a billion years
          ago, but NASA findings have suggested there might still have been
          active lava flow 100 million years ago, when dinosaurs were still
          roaming.
